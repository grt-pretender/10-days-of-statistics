Task 1: Conditional Probability

Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

________________________

Solution:

For 2 children in the family we have 4 possible variants: boy+boy (BB), boy+girl (BG), girl+boy (GB), girl+girl (GG).

Since one child is definitely a boy, GG situation is irrelevant.


Still there are three variants, and probability that both children are boys is 1/3:

P(BB|B) = BB/(BG+GB+BB)
