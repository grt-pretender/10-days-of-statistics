Task 3: Drawing Marbles

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

_____________________

1. Red marbles = 3

2. Blue marbles = 4

3. When we draw the first marble (red) we have 7 options. 

4. When we draw the second one (blue) we have 6 options. 

5. Thus the probability that the second marble is blue is 4/6 = 2/3.
