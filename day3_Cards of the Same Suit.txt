Task 2: Cards of the Same Suit

You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

____________________________________________

Solution: 

1. Deck = 52 cards

2. Deck = 4 suites, 13 cards per suit


3. When we draw the first card we have 52 options. 

4. When we draw the second one we have 51 options. 


5. When we calculate the probability that both cards are of the same suit, we think about the second card to be a match.

6. For this second card we have 12 remaining matching cards in the deck of 51 cards.

7. Thus, P = 12/51 = 4/17
